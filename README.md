# Microsoft Learn Live

Microsoft Learn Live is a series of instructor led courses designed to increase our learners' knowledge of Azure technologies.
As an extension of Microsoft Learn, Learn Live helps learners to connect multiple concepts to complete a real-world project.
Where a typical Learn module focuses on one specific job task, e.g. migrate your SQL database to Azure SQL, a Learn Live series will connect multiple job tasks to complete a full solution, e.g. migrate and secure a web based application to the cloud which includes migration of the database and the existing data.
