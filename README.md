# Microsoft Learn Live

Microsoft Learn Live is a series of instructor led courses designed to increase our learners' knowledge of Azure technologies.
As an extension of Microsoft Learn, Learn Live helps learners to connect multiple concepts to complete a real-world project.
Where a typical Learn module focuses on one specific job task, e.g. migrate your SQL database to Azure SQL, a Learn Live series will connect multiple job tasks to complete a full solution, e.g. migrate and secure a web based application to the cloud which includes migration of the database and the existing data.

It's time to go back to school and you're working on a solution for a school supplies retailer.
In the past, they had users complain about slow website response times during the back-to-school time. 
This year, the shop wants to be prepared. 
Customers should enjoy a highly responsive shopping experience when millions of kids head back to school and buy pencils, glue, rulers, markers, and many other supplies.
The development team decides to overhaul the website and re-implement inventory management using Azure technology.
Instead of the monolithic solution that tightly couples the customer-facing user interface and the inventory system,
they now plan a decoupled system, where the shopping website communicates with the inventory system over 
an HTTP API.
They have already finished work on the new website. 
Also, a cloud-based Cosmos DB storage solution with some test data is set up and configured.
The part still missing is the new inventory system, which must be able to handle the spikes in seasonal
demand without performance degradation. 
Demand is lower during the remainder of the year, so the retailer doesn't want to pay for unused 
infrastructure and is looking for a cost-efficient solution that can scale dynamically 
while keeping maintenance requirements to a minimum.
You want to identify the Azure services relevant for the project and get hands-on experience with them, 
so you can successfully implement the optimal HTTP API.
